        <v1.1>manage your music. Like a boss.

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Version&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
This is version 0.1.132, for RimWorld 1.1.2654.

</v1.1>
        <v1.2>manage your music. Like a boss.

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Features&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
Adds a music player widget to the game, with the usual audio control buttons; pause, play, next song, etc. The widget defaults to the top right of the screen, but can be unlocked in the mod settings, and then moved around at will.

Also included is a larger interface that lists all the songs available, and allows you to disable specific songs, change under which conditions songs are allowed to be played, and start playing any song in the database. Custom metadata is persisted across games. You can reset all meta data in the mods’ settings screen.

You can control the default interval between songs by moving the appropriate sliders in the mods’ settings screen.

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Compatibility with other mods&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
Music Manager is fully compatible with other mods that add music to the game.

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Coming Soon&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
I’ve spend a couple of months slowly adding features to this mod, but it is by no means complete. Over the coming months, I plan to add (or at least think about adding) the following;


playlists
player songs (mp3, etc.)
spotify integration

&amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Known Issues&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
None, yet.
